          This website was created and designed by the late Laszlo Kiss. Mr.
          Kiss, longtime resident of Forrest Lake, Illinois, died suddenly at
          his home on Monday, 11 July 2011, shortly after returning from a walk
          with his wife Marta. He was three days shy of his 73rd birthday. Mr.
          Kiss was born in Budapest, Hungary, on 14 July 1938, and married Marta
          Noske on 31 January 1968. He worked in Budapest as a computer engineer
          until emigrating to the United States of America in 1982. In 1983, he
          developed <i>“Image”</i>, one of the first computer-controlled
          manufacturing systems in the world (still in use to this day). He
          retired in 2000, and, among other things, selflessly devoted hundreds
          of hours to creating this website, which provides free access to many
          different versions of the Divine Office (or <em>breviary</em>), the
          traditional daily prayer book of the Roman Catholic Church. His
          funeral was held at St. Peter's Catholic Church in Volo, Illinois, on
          the Feast of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel (16 July). Mr. Kiss is survived by
          three brothers in Hungary, and in the States by his loving wife Marta
          (of forty-three years), their two sons Zoltan and Chaba, and their two
          grandchildren Sophie and Ryan.

          On Monday, 15 August 2011, the Solemnity of the Assumption of Our
          Lady, The Divinum Officium Project was founded, with the permission of
          Laszlo's son Chaba, to preserve and further Laszlo's work and to
          promote the worship of the Triune God through the Divine Office. This
          website serves as a historical, educational, as well as spiritual tool
          for anyone to learn about this monument of Christian civilization.
          Currently, The Divinum Officium Project consists of a diocesan priest
          as well as a team of software developers who maintain the site and
          ensure its accuracy. We are always happy to welcome new volunteers who
          are familiar with the Church's rites and/or Perl programming. Please
          see our
          <a href="https://github.com/DivinumOfficium/divinum-officium"
            >GitHub repository</a
          >
          for further information, or contact us at the above address.
